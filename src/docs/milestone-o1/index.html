            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>For our web application, we seek to develop a typing game where you type a piece of text and the application tells you your typing speed in words per minute. 
                Typing has quickly become one of the most important and fundamental skills in the modern world. 
                By creating a game that measures your typing speed, we seek to improve the user's typing ability in a way           	
                that is both engaging and simple. For our target audience, we seek to create a web application that is fun and simple to use 
                for anyone who wishes to learn how to type or wishes to improve their typing speed. With this in mind, it is important to create a user interface 
                that is both simple and intuitive, as those with little typing experience would be more likely to have little experience in the way of navigating through web pages.

            <h2>Application Parts</h2>
            <p>
                The word per minute counter is an integral part of our typing game. We want to create 
                a counter that updates while the user is typing in real time. This will allow the user 
                to see if they are slowing up or speeding down while typing a piece of text. 
                After the user has finished typing, the word per minute counter will display words per minute 
                that they achieved for the duration of the entire piece of text. This feature will allow users 
                to track their progress and see how they are improving in a way that is straightforward and easy 
                to comprehend. Additionally, the counter updating in real time will provide a way for users to 
                see what areas of text provide them with the most difficulty.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another feature of our typing game is the piece of text that the user is currently copying from. 
                The text that the user has already finished typing should be highlighted in color to show the user 
                what portion of the text they have already completed, as well as showing the user where they are 
                currently in the piece of text. Additionally, mistakes should be highlighted in a different color 
                to show the user what they need to correct. This feature allows the user to assess the accuracy of 
                their typing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our web application will also display a plot that charts the progression of the user as they become 
                more proficient and their words per minute increases. This will encourage and enable the user to set 
                meaningful and concrete goals for themselves and their typing improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
                To further encourage an improvement mindset in the user, the web application will also have an area 
                where you can set goals for yourself. For this component, the user selects a word per minute average 
                that they want to achieve over a specified number of texts. After completing the specified number of texts, 
                this component will notify the user if they have met or failed to meet their goal.
