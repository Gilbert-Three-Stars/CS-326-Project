            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>For our web application, we seek to develop a typing game where you type a piece of text and the application tells you your typing speed in words per minute. 
                Typing has quickly become one of the most important and fundamental skills in the modern world. 
                By creating a game that measures your typing speed, we seek to improve the user's typing ability in a way           	
                that is both engaging and simple. For our target audience, we seek to create a web application that is fun and simple to use 
                for anyone who wishes to learn how to type or wishes to improve their typing speed. With this in mind, it is important to create a user interface 
                that is both simple and intuitive, as those with little typing experience would be more likely to have little experience in the way of navigating through web pages.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="application-parts">
            <h2>Application Parts</h2>
            <p>
                The word per minute counter is an integral part of our typing game. We want to create 
                a counter that updates while the user is typing in real time. This will allow the user 
                to see if they are slowing up or speeding down while typing a piece of text. 
                After the user has finished typing, the word per minute counter will display words per minute 
                that they achieved for the duration of the entire piece of text. This feature will allow users 
                to track their progress and see how they are improving in a way that is straightforward and easy 
                to comprehend. Additionally, the counter updating in real time will provide a way for users to 
                see what areas of text provide them with the most difficulty.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another feature of our typing game is the piece of text that the user is currently copying from. 
                The text that the user has already finished typing should be highlighted in color to show the user 
                what portion of the text they have already completed, as well as showing the user where they are 
                currently in the piece of text. Additionally, mistakes should be highlighted in a different color 
                to show the user what they need to correct. This feature allows the user to assess the accuracy of 
                their typing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our web application will also display a plot that charts the progression of the user as they become 
                more proficient and their words per minute increases. This will encourage and enable the user to set 
                meaningful and concrete goals for themselves and their typing improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
                To further encourage an improvement mindset in the user, the web application will also have an area 
                where you can set goals for yourself. For this component, the user selects a word per minute average 
                that they want to achieve over a specified number of texts. After completing the specified number of texts, 
                this component will notify the user if they have met or failed to meet their goal.
            </p>

            <h2> Wire Frames</h2>
            <img src="./Screenshot 2024-04-02 232101.png" alt="frame 1">
            <p> Our first wire-frame will show what our page will look like in the beginning. There will be 3 links you can choose from, either to check your stats, to start practicing and typing or to view the goals
                for the next couple of texts. We will also have the name of our web application in this wire-frame. </p> 
            <img src="./Screenshot 2024-04-02 230902.png" alt="frame 2">
            <p> Our next wire-frame will have the text-box we are inputting our words into. We will be writing what the Wikipedia article is showcasing to us. There will be four different tags around this page, such as our WPMs that dynamically updates, our accurate
                rate so far, to restart this text again, or to completely start anew from another text. </p>
            <img src="./Screenshot 2024-04-02 231128.png" alt="frame 3">
            <p> Our next wire-frame will be on our stats. It will showcase our average WPMs as well as our average accuracy. In addition, there will be two different graphs shown, such as our total typing history. The total typing history will showcase the ratio between
                number of texts typed and words per minute. Thus, our performance overtime will be easy to notice. Our other graph will be plotted data points on last ten texts typed. It will show the number of words per minute for each of these texts to give a more specific
                understanding of our user's performance in the last ten rounds. </p>
            <img src="./Screenshot 2024-04-02 232204.png" alt="frame 4">
            <p> Our last wire-frame will be on our Goals. We can input or words per minute goal for a specified number of texts. We can also see our previous goals that will be color-coded. Green for a successful goal and red for failure. </p>

            <h2> Data Requirements</h2>
           <p> Our web application places a good focus on the user data, and we plan to store and use statistics effectively to enhance typing proficiency. 
              Our first data requirement will be to track typing speed, that will provide our user with a clear measure of their performance in terms of words typed per minute (WPM). 
              After this, we plan to show the user their accuracy rate, which monitors the ratio of correctly typed words to the total number of words typed throughout the text. 
              We also plan to analyze error rates, highlighting the frequency of misspelled words to show areas requiring improvement. </p>
            <p> Additionally, we will have performance tracking, offering detailed insight on users' progress across various texts. 
                This feature not only highlights improvements but also identifies areas necessitating further practice and suggests areas for enhancement. 
                Not to mention, our application has user-set goals, allowing the user to define specific objectives, such as achieving a targeted WPM accuracy within a set number of texts. 
                Upon reaching these goals, users receive notifications such as a pop-up, that will help them stay engaged on their improvements. </p>
            <p> In addition, our next data requirement is to help users hone their typing abilities by tracking inaccurate keystrokes and logging that info for further use. 
                By using that data on commonly mistyped letters, we will show a comprehensive heat map visualization that shows the areas where users encounter the most challenges and difficulty. 
                This representation identifies specific keys prone to errors but also provides valuable insights into typing patterns and habits. 
                Users can use this information to plan targeted strategies for improvement, such as focusing on specific letter combinations or practicing particular typing techniques. 
                Also, the heat map will change as users engage in typing exercises, allowing for real-time feedback and becoming more efficient with their typing level.
                 Ultimately, this feature helps users refine their skills with precision and efficiency, guiding them towards mastery in typing accuracy and fluency. </p>
            <p> Lastly, our data requirement offers a selection of texts sourced from Wikipedia articles. These texts encompass a diverse range of topics, exposing users 
                to various vocabulary and writing styles to provide a unique and expanded learning experience. By typing these texts, users can familiarize themselves with different word structures and contexts, 
                enhancing their typing proficiency. </p>
            <p>  In conclusion, our web application is committed to using user typing data to show tailored feedback, personalized goal-setting, and user specific practice materials, all for fostering continuous improvement in typing skills. 
                Through these comprehensive features, users can track their progress, address weaknesses, and ultimately achieve greater proficiency and confidence in typing tasks. </p>
