                <p>My name is Trong Vo and I am pursuing a computer science degree. 
                    I love Computer Science. I have experience coding in Java, Javascript, and C. 
                    I want to be the greatest Web Dev.</p>

                <h3>Gilbert Three Stars</h3>
                <p>My name is Gilbert Three Stars and I have experience writing in Javascript and using Github from CS 220. 
                    I don't have much experience with version control or css/html, so I am excited to develop my skills in these aspects. 
                    I have always enjoyed web applications that measure your typing speed, so I am excited to put my own spin on one of these web applications.</p>

                <h3>Adam Bentahar</h3>
                <p>I am Adam Bentahar, I like typing programs for fun and using coursework to improve my coding skills. 
                    Much of my coding experience is derived from Data Structures, CS 220/230, and AI. 
                    I have lots of experience working with teams and group environments so I think I can bring some insight in forming a cohesive group.</p>

                <p>My name is Yunis Egal and I am very passionate about computer science. I love loops especially while loops. I am looking to get a software engineer job after college. 
                I have a lot of siblings that I love very much. I have experience in Javascript and C. My greatest strength is that I am always willing to learn. 
                My weakness is that I have trouble keeping a deadline. </p>
